Facade Pattern

Provides a simple, easy to understand user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.

For example, a house has many subsystems like AC, electrical, heating etc, but the home buyer doesn't get
exposed to that stuff, the home buyer just cares about the house looking nice and WORKING.

It's the same with software, users of your API expect it to JUST WORK, they don't care about the internals.
