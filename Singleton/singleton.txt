Singleton Pattern

A component which is instantiated only once.

Used for components that we only want to have one instance of in the whole system:
Like Database repository, or an object factory (factories aren't supposed to have a state)

Or when the constructor call is super expensive, so we only want to do it once and provide everyone
with the same instance.

Or we want to prevent anyone from creating additional copies.

A MULTITON is a variation of a singleton, but instead of only allowing
1 instance of an object, it RESTRICTS the number of objects, depending
on some keys.
