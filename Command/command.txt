Command Pattern

Ordinary C++ field assignments are not recorded anywhere. If someone wanted to audit your program to see why the values are the way they are, they wouldn't be able to since C++ statements aren't recorded anywhere

The Command Pattern specifies that we want an object that represents an operation, or a particular action. The object contains all the information necessary for the action to be undertaken. 
	
Example:
	X should change its field Y to the value Z
	X should do W()
