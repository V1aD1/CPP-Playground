Adapter Pattern

So, it's kind of like an adapter for different electrical sockets. An adapter allows devices to run on different 
sockets than they were initially meant to run on. 

In the same way, the adapter pattern is a construct that adapts an EXISTING interface X to conform to an  different
interface Y.
