Template Pattern

Similar to Strategy pattern, in the algorithms can be decomposed into common parts and specific parts

While the strategy pattern does this through composition:
	High-level algorithm uses an interface
	Concrete implementations implement the interface

The Template Method does the same thing through intheritance
	Overall algorithm makes use of an abstract member
	Inheritors override the abstract members

Basically, it allows us to define the skeleton of the algorithm, with concrete implementations defined in subclasses.
