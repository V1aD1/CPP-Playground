Memento Pattern

A system goes through changes, and there are different ways of navigating those changes. One way is to record every change (Command pattern) and allow a command to undo itself. 

Another way is to simply save a snapshot of the system. That is where the Memento pattern comes in. 

The Memento pattern is a token/ handle representing the system state. It allows us to roll back to the state where the token was generated. It may or may NOT directly expose state information.
