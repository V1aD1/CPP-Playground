Builder is a creational design pattern. 

Some objects are complicated to construct, and having a an object with 10 constructor arguments is not
productive. Instead, opt for piecewise construction.

Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step.  

Basically, when piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing in succinctly.
