Observer Pattern

Sometimes we need to be informed when certain things happen: object's field changes, object does something, some external event occurs etc.

We want to listen to EVENTS and be notified when they occur. The entity generating the events is an OBSERVABLE entity.

Keep in mind that there are two different sets of terminology used for this patter: EVENT and SUBSCRIBER, or SIGNAL and SLOT (which are used in Boost, QT etc.)
