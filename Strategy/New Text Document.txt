Strategy Pattern

Much functionality can be decomposed into HIGHER and LOWER level parts

For example making tea involves:
	Boil water, pour it into cup (High level part)
	Put teabag into water (Lower lever, tea specific part)

The high level part can be reused for making coffee or hot chocolate for example.

So, the Strategy Pattern enables the exact behaviour of a system to be selected at run time (dynamic) or compile time (static).

It is also known as a "policy" in the C++ world.
