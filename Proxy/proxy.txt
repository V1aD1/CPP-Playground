Proxy Pattern

A class that functions as an interface to a particular resource, and APPEARS to be the same as that resource. That resource may be remote, expensive to construct, or may require logging or some other added functionality. 

A good example of proxies are smart pointers in C++. They looks an behave just like a normal pointer to a resource, however they have the added benefit of not needing to be manually deleted!
