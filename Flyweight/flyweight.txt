Flyweight Pattern

A space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by externally storing data that is associated
with multiple objects.

For example, if you wanted to render a forest full of trees, you could cut down memory usage significantly
by having every tree share a pointer to the same mesh and texture, and having every tree instance just store
coordinates and rotation etc.
