Chain of Responsibility

A chain of components that all get a chance to process a command or a query, optionally having a default processing implementation and an ability 
to terminate the processing chain.

Example:

You click a graphical element on a form,
	Button itself handles it and stop further processing or,
	Underlying group box can handle it and stop further processing or,
	Underlying window can hande it and stop further processing etc.
